# Griess-Portfolio

This is a portfolio to introduce myself and capture my skills as a web developer. I have thus far demonstrated my skills with HTML and CSS stylesheets. As I progress through this bootcamp, new skills will be added and reflected through the webpage. The end product will showcase what I have learned and present it to a potential employer for hire.
